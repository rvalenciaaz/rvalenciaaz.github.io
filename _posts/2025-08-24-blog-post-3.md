Let's start the journey with one of best examples of why quantum mechanics is necessary, i.e, a noticiable break of the predictions of classical physics regarding microscopic (nanoscopic?) phenomena.







This is the typical derivation of Planck's formula. When I attended my physics course at undergraduate, I remember that they did a slighly different derivation . It is based on counting states in the phase space and the notion of an "statistics".

Let's suppose the cavity is a box with all lengths of size $L$.
