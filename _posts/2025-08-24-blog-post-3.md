Let's start the journey with one of best examples of why quantum mechanics is necessary, i.e, a noticiable break of the predictions of classical physics regarding microscopic (nanoscopic?) phenomena.







This is the typical derivation of Planck formula. When I attended my physics course at undergraduate, I remember that they did a derivation slighly different. It is based on counting states in phase space and the definition of an "statistics".
