I have to admit I'm a book hoarder. In between of the collection, a few books on quantum mechanics that I mostly got from charity ships are now reaching the surface in my room. Although not superstitious, I think it is a sign that it would be nice to devote time during the week to specifically learn (or relearn?) quantum mechanics.

Why? No reason in particular, but I think there's a natural appealing in trying to understand a theory about nature which has been so succesful. After all, human models of the world over the centuries have been far from perfect, so when you find a framework like this, it feels like observing an eternal gem, a fruit of the curiosity.

How deep? I think it would enough for me to have a practical understanding of quantum mechanics for chemical applications. So after exploring the basics and angular momentum theory, I'd go for molecular quantum mechanics as next step.

Quantum mechanics, as a teacher in Chile told me long time ago, is at heart an experimental science. Physicists have devised a diversity of clever experiments that gives clear measurements, which can be compared directly with equations' predictions. I'll try to highlight experiments that are not well known, beyond the classic ones, specially on the quantum nature of light (quantum optics).
