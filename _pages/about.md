**Looking for a Scientist/Postdoc position on Bayesian Optimisation/Synthetic Biology/Automation/Metabolomics**

I'm Ricardo Valencia Albornoz, last year PhD student at the IQB3, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. My current research focus on working towards an automated biochemist by combining AI/ML for iterative experimentation, metabolomics, robotics and automation. My supervisors are [Karl Burgess](https://burgess.bio.ed.ac.uk/) and [Diego OyarzÃºn](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/). Before my PhD, I was a research assistant at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a in ValparaÃ­so, Chile, helping in general bioinformatics, bacterial genomics and natural product discovery in the phylum Actinomycetota. I got my (6-year) bachelor degree at the same university on the topic of Environmental Engineering. My home town is Villa Alemana, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. 

Recent news
======

I participated in the Cambridge Ellis Unit Summer School in Probabilistic Machine Learning from 15 July to 19 July 2024, organised by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cambridge. 5 days packed with a broad range of topics including basic probablistic models, good practices at modelling, reinforcement learning, transformer theory, causal modelling, Monte-Carlo methods and more. Many thanks to the amazing organizers, speakers and the summer school attendants, who were kind to share new ideas in probabilistic learning. Some of the slides from the sessions are [here](https://www.ellis.eng.cam.ac.uk/summer-school/).<br/><img src='/images/IMG_8499.jpg'>

Together with Martyna Kasprzyk, we're organising a Edinburgh University-wide workshop on Opentrons robot usage, covering case studies and tutorials. If you're interested in the workshop, please write to r.g.valencia-albornoz@sms.ed.ac.uk or m.kasprzyk@sms.ed.ac.uk, telling us your experience (or curiosity) with Opentrons robots, and what would you like to learn in the sessions. Programme will be announced soon.

I attended on Monday 22 of May 2024 the Paris OECD Global Forum on Technology: Building Biofutures. Great room for the discussion of the impacts of synthetic biology in national economies, and how platform investment and bio security training are essential to deliver solutions faster. Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± needs a synthetic biology roadmap if it wants to be a leader in the global market.

Upcoming conferences
======

I will attend back to back conferences in AI for chemistry in September, showing the results from our [hackathon project](https://ac-bo-hackathon.github.io/projects/project-16-bope-gpt/) combining preferential Bayesian Optimisation and LLMs. Check the [Github repo here](https://github.com/AC-BO-Hackathon/BOPE-GPT). The first will be the [Faraday Discussion on Data-driven discovery in the chemical sciences](https://www.rsc.org/events/detail/76887/data-driven-discovery-in-the-chemical-sciences-faraday-discussion), at Trinity College, Oxford from the 10 to the 12 of September 2024. Then, I will travel to Cambridge for the [7th RSC-CICAG/RSC-BMCS Artificial Intelligence in Chemistry 2024](https://www.rscbmcs.org/events/aichem7/) at Churchill College from the 16th to the 18th of September 2024.
