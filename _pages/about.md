I'm Ricardo Valencia Albornoz, last year PhD student at the IQB3, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. My current research focus on working towards an automated biochemist by combining AI/ML for iterative experimentation, metabolomics, robotics and automation. Before my PhD, I was a research assistant at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a in ValparaÃ­so, Chile, helping in general bioinformatics, bacterial genomics and natural product discovery in the phylum Actinomycetota. I got my (6-year) bachelor degree at the same university on the topic of Environmental Engineering. My home town is Villa Alemana, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. 

Recent news
======
Together with Martyna Kasprzyk, we're organising a Edinburgh University-wide workshop on Opentrons robot usage, covering case studies and tutorials. If you're interested in the workshop, please write to r.g.valencia-albornoz@sms.ed.ac.uk or m.kasprzyk@sms.ed.ac.uk, telling us your experience (or curiosity) with Opentrons robots, and what would you like to learn in the sessions. Programme will be announced soon.

Upcoming conferences
======
I'll be attending The Automated Scientist â€“ the future of cell factory engineering, organised by the Novo Nordisk Foundation Science Cluster in Favrholm, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° during 11-15 March 2024. I'll show some of the work related to optimisation of surfactin production using Bayesian optimisation and metabolomics. [https://sciencecluster.dk/event/6966/](Click here for more)

I'm happy to announce that my abstract was accepted for an Offered Talk at the Annual Conference of the Microbiology Society, Edinburgh ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. The talk will be part of the Microbial Physiology, Metabolism and Molecular Biology forum on 10 April 2024.
