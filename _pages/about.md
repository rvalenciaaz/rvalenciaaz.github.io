**Looking for a Scientist/Postdoc position on Bayesian Optimisation/Synthetic Biology/Automation/Metabolomics**

I'm Ricardo Valencia Albornoz, last year PhD student at the IQB3, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. My current research focus on working towards an automated biochemist by combining AI/ML for iterative experimentation, metabolomics, robotics and automation. My supervisors are [Karl Burgess](https://burgess.bio.ed.ac.uk/) and [Diego OyarzÃºn](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/). Before my PhD, I was a research assistant at the Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa MarÃ­a in ValparaÃ­so, Chile, helping in general bioinformatics, bacterial genomics and natural product discovery in the phylum Actinomycetota. I got my (6-year) bachelor degree at the same university on the topic of Environmental Engineering. My home town is Villa Alemana, ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±. 

Recent news
======
Together with Martyna Kasprzyk, we're organising a Edinburgh University-wide workshop on Opentrons robot usage, covering case studies and tutorials. If you're interested in the workshop, please write to r.g.valencia-albornoz@sms.ed.ac.uk or m.kasprzyk@sms.ed.ac.uk, telling us your experience (or curiosity) with Opentrons robots, and what would you like to learn in the sessions. Programme will be announced soon.

I attended on Monday 22 of May the Paris OECD Global Forum on Technology: Building Biofutures. Great room for the discussion of the impacts of synthetic biology in national economies, and how platform investment and bio security training are essential to deliver solutions faster. Chile ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± needs a synthetic biology roadmap if it wants to be a leader in the global market.
