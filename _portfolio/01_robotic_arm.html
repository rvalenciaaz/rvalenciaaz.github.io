title: "The robotic arm is alive!"
excerpt: "Opentrons is a platform with a huge flexibility, but nevertheless some operations such as tube moving, opening the lid of the ChiBio reactors, among others, rquiere an extra arm. For this purpose, I built this robotic arm, which is big enough to reach the deck area and small enough to fit into the Opentrons OT-2. The design is entirely from Kelton Serra (Youtube channel: [Build some Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/@buildsomestuff)), who kindly share the 3D models. You can watch the [original video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5toNqaGsGYs&ab_channel=BuildSomeStuff) and the tutorials [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIsVlgopqJc&ab_channel=BuildSomeStuff) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiQKw0lZ5Rw&ab_channel=BuildSomeStuff).Please suscribe if you can. <br/><img src='/images/IMG_7731.jpg'>"
