title: "Building the open-source Inkwell"
excerpt: "Building Inkwell was an amazing experience. It's a non electrical device to produce consistent biological smears (usually blood, but also works with microbial cultures)
. The core mechanism is the spring connected to the syring plunger. Using the valve, the amount of air flow through the end of the syringe can be controlled. At the right spot, the reduced air output acts a dampener of the spring action, and make it approximately linear in speed. The design was conceived for the Manu Prakash lab in Stanford. More information about the assembly, mechanical details and on-field testing  can be found in their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PrakashLab/status/1711099362951233844) and [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10200). so<br/><img src='/images/9e22f067-7ff1-4511-93b2-0ddc81a24aba.JPG'>"
