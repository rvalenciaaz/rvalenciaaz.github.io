title: "A basic configuration for automation in biology using Opentrons and ChiBio"
excerpt: "Opentrons and ChiBio combined are strong for automatising protocols involving starter cultures. This primary configuration uses 4 minireactors inside the deck, to give enough space for tubes, plates and tips inside. Currently the reactors are being used as starters cultures (LB medium) that will be transfer to the plate, where each well has different culture medium composition. The results are later fed to recommend new combinations and generate the scripts to control the Opentrons robot and Chibio on the next iteration. Everything automatised with Python, including [alerts](https://github.com/rvalenciaaz/3D_models_bio_automation/tree/main) for system crashes, and happening inside the UV-lamp desinfected deck. <br/><img src='/images/IMG_7698.jpg'>"
